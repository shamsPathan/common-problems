# If internet is not working after installing Valet(laravel), ask yourself

-- Does the output of systemctl status dnsmasq has errors?
-- Is the file /opt/valet-linux/dns-servers empty?
-- Does the /opt/valet-linux/resolv.conf file have only 127.0.0.1 as its nameserver?
-- Is /etc/resolv.conf a symlink to /opt/valet-linux/resolv.conf?


sollutions may work:

-- systemctl restart dnsmasq


-- override resolv.conf

Put a script like this in /etc/Networkmanager/dispatcher.d/ and don't forget to make it executable:

#!/bin/bash
#
# Override /etc/resolv.conf and tell
# NetworkManagerDispatcher to go pluck itself.
#
# scripts in the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ directory
# are called alphabetically and are passed two parameters:
# $1 is the interface name, and $2 is "up" or "down" as the
# case may be.

# Here, no matter what interface or state, override the
# created resolver config with my config.

cp -f /etc/resolv.conf.override /etc/resolv.conf


File: /etc/resolv.conf.override

nameserver 127.0.0.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
