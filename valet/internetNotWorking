# If internet is not working after installing Valet(laravel), ask yourself

-- Does the output of systemctl status dnsmasq has errors?
-- Is the file /opt/valet-linux/dns-servers empty?
-- Does the /opt/valet-linux/resolv.conf file have only 127.0.0.1 as its nameserver?
-- Is /etc/resolv.conf a symlink to /opt/valet-linux/resolv.conf?
